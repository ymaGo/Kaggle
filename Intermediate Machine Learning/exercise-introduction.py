# You will work with data from the [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course) to predict home prices in Iowa using 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of the homes.

# Run the next code cell without changes to load the training and validation features in `X_train` and `X_valid`, along with the prediction targets in `y_train` and `y_valid`.  The test features are loaded in `X_test`.  (_If you need to review **features** and **prediction targets**, please check out [this short tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/your-first-machine-learning-model).  To read about model **validation**, look [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/model-validation).  Alternatively, if you'd prefer to look through a full course to review all of these topics, start [here](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning).)_

# The next code cell defines five different random forest models.  Run this code cell without changes.  (_To review **random forests**, look [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests)._)

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Define the models
model_1 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50, random_state=0)
model_2 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)

models = [model_1, model_2, model_3, model_4, model_5]


# To select the best model out of the five, we define a function `score_model()` below.  This function returns the mean absolute error (MAE) from the validation set.  Recall that the best model will obtain the lowest MAE.  (_To review **mean absolute error**, look [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/model-validation).)_

    model.fit(X_t, y_t)
    preds = model.predict(X_v)
    return mean_absolute_error(y_v, preds)

for i in range(0, len(models)):
    mae = score_model(models[i])
    print("Model %d MAE: %d" % (i+1, mae))


# # Step 1: Evaluate several models
# 
# Use the above results to fill in the line below.  Which model is the best model?  Your answer should be one of `model_1`, `model_2`, `model_3`, `model_4`, or `model_5`.

# In[ ]:


# Fill in the best model
best_model = model_3

# Check your answer
step_1.check()

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_1.hint()
#step_1.solution()


# # Step 2: Generate test predictions
# 
# Great. You know how to evaluate what makes an accurate model. Now it's time to go through the modeling process and make predictions. In the line below, create a Random Forest model with the variable name `my_model`.

# In[ ]:


# Define a model
my_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, criterion='mae', random_state=0) # Your code here

# Check your answer
step_2.check()

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_2.hint()
#step_2.solution()


# Run the next code cell without changes.  The code fits the model to the training and validation data, and then generates test predictions that are saved to a CSV file.  These test predictions can be submitted directly to the competition!

# In[ ]:


# Fit the model to the training data
my_model.fit(X, y)

# Generate test predictions
preds_test = my_model.predict(X_test)

# Save predictions in format used for competition scoring
output = pd.DataFrame({'Id': X_test.index,
                       'SalePrice': preds_test})
output.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)


# # Submit your results
# 
# Once you have successfully completed Step 2, you're ready to submit your results to the leaderboard!  First, you'll need to join the competition if you haven't already.  So open a new window by clicking on [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).  Then click on the **Join Competition** button.  _(If you see a "Submit Predictions" button instead of a "Join Competition" button, you have already joined the competition, and don't need to do so again.)_
# 
# Next, follow the instructions below:
# 1. Begin by clicking on the **Save Version** button in the top right corner of the window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  
# 2. Ensure that the **Save and Run All** option is selected, and then click on the **Save** button.
# 3. This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **Save Version** button.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen.  Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.
# 4. Click on the **Output** tab on the right of the screen.  Then, click on the file you would like to submit, and click on the **Submit** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.
# 
# You have now successfully submitted to the competition!
# 
# If you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your code and repeat the process. There's a lot of room to improve, and you will climb up the leaderboard as you work.
# 

# # Keep going
# 
# You've made your first model. But how can you quickly make it better?
