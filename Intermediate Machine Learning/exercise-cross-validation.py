# So far, you've learned how to build pipelines with scikit-learn.  For instance, the pipeline below will use [`SimpleImputer()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html) to replace missing values in the data, before using [`RandomForestRegressor()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) to train a random forest model to make predictions.  We set the number of trees in the random forest model with the `n_estimators` parameter, and setting `random_state` ensures reproducibility.

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

my_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', SimpleImputer()),
    ('model', RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50, random_state=0))
])


# You have also learned how to use pipelines in cross-validation.  The code below uses the [`cross_val_score()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html) function to obtain the mean absolute error (MAE), averaged across five different folds.  Recall we set the number of folds with the `cv` parameter.

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Multiply by -1 since sklearn calculates *negative* MAE
scores = -1 * cross_val_score(my_pipeline, X, y,
                              cv=5,
                              scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')

print("Average MAE score:", scores.mean())


# # Step 1: Write a useful function
# 
# In this exercise, you'll use cross-validation to select parameters for a machine learning model.
# 
# Begin by writing a function `get_score()` that reports the average (over three cross-validation folds) MAE of a machine learning pipeline that uses:
# - the data in `X` and `y` to create folds,
# - `SimpleImputer()` (with all parameters left as default) to replace missing values, and
# - `RandomForestRegressor()` (with `random_state=0`) to fit a random forest model.
# 
# The `n_estimators` parameter supplied to `get_score()` is used when setting the number of trees in the random forest model.  

# In[ ]:


def get_score(n_estimators):
    """Return the average MAE over 3 CV folds of random forest model.
    
    Keyword argument:
    n_estimators -- the number of trees in the forest
    """
    get_score_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', SimpleImputer()),
    ('model', RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators, random_state=0))])
    
    scores = -1 * cross_val_score(get_score_pipeline, X, y,
                              cv=3,
                              scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')
    return scores.mean()

# Check your answer

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_1.hint()
#step_1.solution()


# # Step 2: Test different parameter values
# 
# Now, you will use the function that you defined in Step 1 to evaluate the model performance corresponding to eight different values for the number of trees in the random forest: 50, 100, 150, ..., 300, 350, 400.
# 
# Store your results in a Python dictionary `results`, where `results[i]` is the average MAE returned by `get_score(i)`.

# In[ ]:


# Your code here
results={}
for i in range(8):
    results[(i+1)*50] = get_score((i+1)*50)
results
# Check your answer
step_2.check()


# In[ ]:


print(results)


# In[ ]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
step_2.hint()
step_2.solution()


# Use the next cell to visualize your results from Step 2.  Run the code without changes.

# In[ ]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

plt.plot(list(results.keys()), list(results.values()))
plt.show()


# # Step 3: Find the best parameter value
# 
# Given the results, which value for `n_estimators` seems best for the random forest model?  Use your answer to set the value of `n_estimators_best`.

# In[ ]:


n_estimators_best = 200

# In this exercise, you have explored one method for choosing appropriate parameters in a machine learning model.  
# 
# If you'd like to learn more about [hyperparameter optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization), you're encouraged to start with **grid search**, which is a straightforward method for determining the best _combination_ of parameters for a machine learning model.  Thankfully, scikit-learn also contains a built-in function [`GridSearchCV()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) that can make your grid search code very efficient!

# Continue to learn about **[gradient boosting](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/xgboost)**, a powerful technique that achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets.
