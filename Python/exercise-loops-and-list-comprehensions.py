# Next to the Blackjack table, the Python Challenge Casino has a slot machine. You can get a result from the slot machine by calling `play_slot_machine()`. The number it returns is your winnings in dollars. Usually it returns 0.  But sometimes you'll get lucky and get a big payday. Try running it below:

# In[ ]:


play_slot_machine()


# By the way, did we mention that each play costs $1? Don't worry, we'll send you the bill later.
# 
# On average, how much money can you expect to gain (or lose) every time you play the machine?  The casino keeps it a secret, but you can estimate the average value of each pull using a technique called the **Monte Carlo method**. To estimate the average outcome, we simulate the scenario many times, and return the average result.
# 
# Complete the following function to calculate the average value per play of the slot machine.

# In[ ]:


def estimate_average_slot_payout(n_runs):
    """Run the slot machine n_runs times and return the average net profit per run.
    Example calls (note that return value is nondeterministic!):
    >>> estimate_average_slot_payout(1)
    -1
    >>> estimate_average_slot_payout(1)
    0.5
    """
#     sum=0
#     for i in range(n_runs):
#         sum=sum+play_slot_machine()
#     return sum/n_runs
    return sum([play_slot_machine() for i in range(n_runs)]) / n_runs
estimate_average_slot_payout(1000000)


# When you think you know the expected value per spin, run the code cell below to view the solution and get credit for answering the question.

# Many programmers report that dictionaries are their favorite data structure. You'll get to **[learn about them](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/strings-and-dictionaries)** (as well as strings) in the next lesson.
