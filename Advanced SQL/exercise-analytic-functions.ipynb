Towards this goal, you'd like to create a plot that shows a rolling average of the daily number of taxi trips.  Amend the (partial) query below to return a DataFrame with two columns:\n- `trip_date` - contains one entry for each date from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017.\n- `avg_num_trips` - shows the average number of daily trips, calculated over a window including the value for the current date, along with the values for the preceding 15 days and the following 15 days, as long as the days fit within the two-year time frame.  For instance, when calculating the value in this column for January 5, 2016, the window will include the number of trips for the preceding 4 days, the current date, and the following 15 days.\n\nThis query is partially completed for you, and you need only write the part that calculates the `avg_num_trips` column.  Note that this query uses a common table expression (CTE); if you need to review how to use CTEs, you're encouraged to check out [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/as-with) in the [Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) micro-course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fill in the blank below\navg_num_trips_query = \"\"\"\n                      WITH trips_by_day AS\n                      (\n                      SELECT DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date,\n                          COUNT(*) as num_trips\n                      FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`\n                      WHERE trip_start_timestamp >= '2016-01-01' AND trip_start_timestamp < '2018-01-01'\n                      GROUP BY trip_date\n                      ORDER BY trip_date\n                      )\n                      SELECT trip_date,\n                          AVG(num_trips)\n                          OVER (\n                               order by trip_date\n                               ROWS BETWEEN 15 PRECEDING AND 15 FOLLOWING\n                               ) AS avg_num_trips\n                      FROM trips_by_day\n                      \"\"\"\n\n# Check your answer\nq_1.check()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-15T04:59:58.189631Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-15T04:59:58.190189Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-15T04:59:59.226281Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-15T04:59:58.190149Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-15T04:59:59.225427Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n#q_1.hint()\n#q_1.solution()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2) Can you separate and order trips by community area?\n\nThe query below returns a DataFrame with three columns from the table: `pickup_community_area`, `trip_start_timestamp`, and `trip_end_timestamp`.  \n\nAmend the query to return an additional column called `trip_number` which shows the order in which the trips were taken from their respective community areas.
